(Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss)

Ah
Surrender me a kiss
Let me loose on you, inch by inch

The one and only reason
Is fun, fun, fun
I said, "Well, baby (well, baby)
We've only just begun"

So don't talk, just kiss
We're beyond words and sound
Don't talk, just kiss
Let your tongue fool around
Let's fool around

Ooh yeah (ah-ha?)
There's people
There's love
You and I both apply to the above

The one and only reason
Is fun, fun, fun
I said, "Well, baby (well, baby)
We've only just begun"

So don't talk, just kiss
We're beyond words and sound
Don't talk, just kiss
Let your tongue fool around

Ah-ha (ah-ha?)
We're wasting precious time
Don't talk, kiss, ah
And make it mine

The one and only reason
Is fun, fun, fun
I said, "Well, baby (well, baby)
We've only just begun"

So don't talk, just kiss (don't talk, just, just kiss me)
We're beyond words and sound (it's all I need you to do, baby)
Don't talk, just kiss
Let your tongue fool around

Come on, come on, come on, come on, fool around (fooling)
Come on, come on, come on, come on, fool around (don't talk, just kiss, baby)
Come on, come on, come on, come on, fool around
(Surrender your love to me, yeah)

So don't talk, just kiss
We're beyond words and sound
Don't talk, just kiss
Let your tongue fool around

So don't talk, just kiss (hey yeah)
We're beyond words and sound (hey)
Don't talk, just kiss
Let your tongue fool around

Let's fool around, what d'you say?
Let's fool around, what d'you say?
